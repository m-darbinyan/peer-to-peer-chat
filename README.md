# Peer-to-Peer Chat

A console-based Java application that enables peer-to-peer communication via TCP socket connections. Clients can communicate with each other by sending either private (to a particular client) or public (to all the clients) messages. The project is built following Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, ensuring modularity and maintainability.
